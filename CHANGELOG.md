# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Basic GitHub Action to ensure continuous integration
- Added individual .bat files for each game service pointing directly to the respective `bin\debug` folder.
- Added configuration for the game server. You can edit the `App.config` file in the `GameServer` project root for local settings and add working defaults in `App.Default.config`.
  `App.config` will be generated from `App.Default.config` if not present before build.
  Currently, the only option present is the Serilog log level.
- Added cli options parsing. Currently, the only option is the log level. Specifying wrong options will not stop the server from starting.
- Added 404 handling to the web server pipeline which prints the contents of 404-producing requests as warnings to see what's missing.
- Added ClientEventController with a corresponding endpoint to receive the events from the client. Currently, only the client uptime seems to be posted on exit of the game
